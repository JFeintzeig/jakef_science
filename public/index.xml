      <description>Since I learned about compiler optimization levels, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone down a deep rabbit hole of CPU performance optimization. I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented multi-threading and SIMD. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about instruction-level-parallelism and CPU pipelines and memory hierarchy. I&amp;rsquo;ve read instruction timing tables and disassembled and reassembled.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of changes that I thought were really clever but instead made my program slower. I&amp;rsquo;ve also made some changes that I didn&amp;rsquo;t think would make a difference but led to significant gains.</description>

      <title>gcc -wtf: Optimizing my Ray Tracer, Part I</title>

      <description>Inspired by others at the Recurse Center, I recently built a ray tracer by working through the excellent book Ray Tracing in a Weekend. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning C and was attracted to this project because it was complex enough to be interesting but small enough to be time-constrained (my implementation is ~1,000 lines of code); there&amp;rsquo;s minimal dependencies so I can focus on learning C instead of learning APIs; and the end result is a pretty picture:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never written anything on the internet before. Sure I&amp;rsquo;ve sent emails, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a website or blog and I don&amp;rsquo;t post on forums or social media (I&amp;rsquo;m perhaps the only former Twitter employee who has never sent a tweet). I&amp;rsquo;ve just never had much to say that hadn&amp;rsquo;t already been said. And 2024 feels like a weird time to start a blog, given how the internet works these days.</description>
