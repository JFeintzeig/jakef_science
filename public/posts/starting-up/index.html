				<p>I&rsquo;ve never written anything on the internet before. Sure I&rsquo;ve sent emails, but I&rsquo;ve never had a website or blog and I don&rsquo;t post on forums or social media (I&rsquo;m perhaps the only former Twitter employee who has <a href="https://twitter.com/jfeintzeig">never sent a tweet</a>). I&rsquo;ve just never had much to say that hadn&rsquo;t already been said. And 2024 feels like a weird time to start a blog, given how the internet works these days.</p>
<p>But I <em>am</em> starting a blog, for two reasons. The first is because I&rsquo;m attending the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> (RC). It&rsquo;s been super engaging to be surrounded by people exploring every imaginable aspect of computers (and some unimaginable) and sharing that knowledge. People share in a lot of ways, including blog posts: RC&rsquo;s internal chat app has a stream dedicated to blogs written by people in the community. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading these and generally participating in this learning culture. So far I&rsquo;ve mostly shared through presentations and interest groups and writing daily snippets (in said chat app). But longer-form writing seems like a great way to dig into more complex topics and get more attentive feedback, and it&rsquo;d be nice to be able to also <em>contribute</em> to the blogging culture instead of just lurking.</p>
<p>But more than that, the other reason I wanted to start a blog is: just for me. In the past I struggled to think of an intended audience for any writing I did &ndash; who would be interested? Who would want to hear my perspective? But at RC, <em>everything</em> I&rsquo;ve been doing &ndash; building emulators, working through CTFs, learning about CPU architecture &ndash; has been <em>just for me</em>. I haven&rsquo;t been writing code with the intention that anyone will use it &ndash; even I don&rsquo;t use most of it! But it&rsquo;s still been fun and worthwhile. And if writing for myself will help me accomplish my learning goals, why shouldn&rsquo;t I do that too?</p>
<p>So this blog is an experiment. I hope to write about computer things I find interesting: these days mostly security and low-level programming. I may also write about the experience and process of learning. I hope to <em>improve</em> my writing but not sweat the details or worry about making everything I write the best it can be. And if it&rsquo;s not helpful for me, I&rsquo;ll stop.</p>
<p>If this sounds interesting to you, I hope you&rsquo;ll join me!</p>
